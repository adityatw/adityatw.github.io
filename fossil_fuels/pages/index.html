<h1>Global Fossil Fuels Consumption</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>In this series or visualizations, we will explore the world consumption from coal, oil, and natural gas.</span></li>
        <li>We start with the following chart that shows the growth of the world consumption of all three fossil fuels from 1800 until 2022. The chart shows that coal has been used since 1800 (and could possibly be earlier), while oil and gas started around 1880-1890.</li>
        <li>We will then look at how the G7 countries lead in the effort to move away from fossil fuel consumption, followed by a review on the trend in individual country.</li>
        <li>We close the analysis with reviewing the world reserve of these fossil fuels as of 2022.</li>
    </ul>
